# **ReconMaster - The Ultimate Recon Tool for Bug Bounty Hunters & Pen Testers**

**ReconMaster** is a powerful, all-in-one reconnaissance tool designed specifically for **bug bounty hunters** and **penetration testers**. It streamlines the **reconnaissance phase**—the most critical part of penetration testing—by automating the discovery of hidden attack surfaces and valuable information. Whether you're scouting for **subdomains**, **vulnerabilities**, or **leaked credentials**, **ReconMaster** has you covered.
